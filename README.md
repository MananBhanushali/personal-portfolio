## Background
Many a times, people have been asking me to reflect what I've built on my personal website. I wanted to do so, but could'nt find enough time to build a stellar website. So here I did, I built up a kick-ass static website that showcases my work over the years.

I've wanted it to be centered upon good design and for which I have made use of barba and a lot of images alongside smooth animations and effects to give each visitor the exact look and feel of my work!

I further believe that design should inspire, and ignite the passion n the viewer and I have done my best here and I hope everyone would like it!

### How I built it 

I've thought about using NodeJS at first, but ventured upon HTML,CSS, and JavaScript as Node would be overkill for a simple project as this. Yes, only HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and JQuery are used in this project. I wanted it to be a static site and fast. Moreover, it had to be mobile compatible. Mobile compatibility and speed were important to me. Because I worked intensively on SEO on many blog sites I opened before, I wanted to act with this awareness. But I regretted having to theme the styles all the way, took inspiration from some WP themes, but in the end mixed them all up instead of using their styles/theme.

After I made a working copy, I utilized Digital Ocean to host the website and further tweak from there. I minimized most scripts and stylesheets in hope that the page loads faster. And it did!

The colors used to define the website are pure white and black (#FFFFFF and #000000).
The font used is the Unica typespace.
